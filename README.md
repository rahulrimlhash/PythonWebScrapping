## PythonWebScrapping
Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the contents of a website. The website in question is Wikipedia, and the contents have been extracted and converted into an Excel sheet.

Project Details
The goal of this project was to extract the contents of a Wikipedia page using Python and the BeautifulSoup library. The extracted contents were then cleaned and processed before being written to an Excel file using the Pandas library.

The resulting Excel file contains a table of the extracted data, which can be used for further analysis or visualization.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

BeautifulSoup
Pandas
Usage
To use this project, simply run the scraper.py file. The script will scrape the contents of the specified Wikipedia page and write the extracted data to an Excel file.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Python and the BeautifulSoup library can be used to extract data from websites, and how the resulting data can be processed and analyzed using other libraries such as Pandas.
